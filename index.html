    <h4>ASTROPHYSICS</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and 
        principles of physics and chemistry in the study of 
        astronomical objects and phenomena.In practice, modern astronomical 
        research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. 
        Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties 
        of dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and other celestial bodies; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe</p>

    <h4>Current Programs</h4>
    <hr>
    <P>At NASA, a Program refers to one or more coordinated efforts of space exploration, Astrophysics comprises of three 
        focused and two cross-cutting Programs. 
        These focused Programs provide an intellectual framework for advancing science and conducting strategic planning.</P>

<h4>THE FUTURE</h4>
<P style="background-color: lightyellow;">Since the 2001 decadal survey, the way the universe is viewed has changed dramatically. 
    More than 3800 planets have been discovered orbiting distant stars. Black holes are now known to be present at the center of most galaxies, 
    including the Milky Way galaxy. The age, size and shape of the universe have been mapped based on the primordial radiation left by the big bang. 
    And it has been learned that most of the matter in the universe is dark and invisible, and the universe is not only expanding, but accelerating in an unexpected way.</P>
