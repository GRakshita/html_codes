    <h4>ASTROPHYSICS</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and 
        principles of physics and chemistry in the study of 
        astronomical objects and phenomena.In practice, modern astronomical 
        research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics. 
        Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties 
        of dark matter, dark energy, black holes, and other celestial bodies; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe</p>

    <h4>Current Programs</h4>
    <hr>
    <P>At NASA, a Program refers to one or more coordinated efforts of space exploration, Astrophysics comprises of three 
        focused and two cross-cutting Programs. 
        These focused Programs provide an intellectual framework for advancing science and conducting strategic planning.</P>
